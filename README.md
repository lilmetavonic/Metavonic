Hi, I'm Dishann.
I'm a middle school student and I make projects based on the Web3 and Blockchains networks like Solana, Ethereum, BNB and more.

I have a good experience in the Crypto and Web3 industry. I'm also an investor of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, BNB, and More.
I'm a decent developer/programmer in Python, Solidity and Rust and currently learning Java and JS.

Goodbye!
