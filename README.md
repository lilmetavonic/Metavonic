Hi, I'm Metavonic. I usally build projects on the ethereum, bsc, solana and optimism networks.
I'm now working on a DeFi project.
You can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lilnightfall) and [Instagram](https://instagram.com/metavonic).
I'm still in middle school so you can say that building projects is my part-time job.
Good Bye!
